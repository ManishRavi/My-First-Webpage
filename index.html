                <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World
                    Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or W3).

                    Founded and currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, the consortium is made up of member organizations
                    which maintain full-time staff for the purpose of working together in the development of standards
                    for the World Wide Web. As of 24 September 2017, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has 474
                    members.[3][2]

                    The W3C also engages in education and outreach, develops software and serves as an open forum for
                    discussion about the Web. </p>

                <p> The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European
                    Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) (Conseil Europ�en pour la Recherche Nucl�aire) in October,
                    1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science
                    (MIT/LCS) with support from the European Commission and the Defense Advanced Research Projects
                    Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet.</p>
                <p> The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption
                    of new standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors,
                    causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors
                    to implement a set of core principles and components which are chosen by the consortium.</p>
